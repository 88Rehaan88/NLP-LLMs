# BBC News Classification: Logistic Regression, SVM & Random Forest

üìå **Project Overview**

This project focuses on text classification of BBC news articles into five categories: tech, business, sport, politics, and entertainment. The classification is performed using three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. Various feature extraction techniques have been applied to improve model performance.

üìÇ **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is BBC News Classification Dataset, which consists of articles labeled into five categories:

- Tech

- Business

- Sport

- Politics

- Entertainment

üöÄ **Features & Techniques**

- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization

- Feature Engineering:

- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

- Bag of Words (BoW)

- Word Embeddings (Word2Vec)

- Feature Selection: Dimensionality reduction to improve efficiency

**Model Training & Evaluation:**

- Logistic Regression

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Random Forest

Performance Comparison: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score analysis

üìù **Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest for text classification tasks. Through feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF and Word2Vec, we improved model performance. The evaluation metrics provide insights into the strengths of each model.

üìå **Future Improvements:**

- Experimenting with Deep Learning models (BERT, LSTM, or CNNs)

- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance
